Finally, we remark that the unique manifestation of SOC demonstrated herein is not limited to \CROns, but should be widely visible in other ruthenates. Given that interpretations of ruthenates have largely been based on neglecting the vital role of SOC, our work calls for reinvestigation of the distinct correlated electron phenomena in 4$d$ TMO, such as the orbital ordering transition in La$_4$Ru$_2$O$_{10}$ and the spin-one Haldane gap in Tl$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.
