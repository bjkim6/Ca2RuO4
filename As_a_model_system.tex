As a model system, we study the archetypal 4$d$ Mott insulator \CROns, which is closely related to the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. A redistribution of four $4d$ valence electrons among three $t_{2g}$ orbitals through structural distortions leads to a Mott transition between the two compounds. In \CROns, a ($\pi$,$\pi$) antiferromagnetic order of $\approx$1.3 $\mu_B$ moments develops below T$_N$$\approx$110 K, for which the underlying electronic structure still remains an open question, representing one of the most challenging problems of electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. We use  inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to reveal its spin-wave spectra, and analyze the competing interactions among spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom imprinted on the dynamical structure factor.
