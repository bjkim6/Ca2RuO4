\label{fig:fig1} {\bf Evolution of the spin-wave dispersion as a function of $\delta$.} Spectra (a) in the paramgetic phase at $\delta$=0; (b) on the brink of the QCP at $\delta$=0.4; (c) near the QCP in the ordered phase at $\delta$=0.5; (d) further away from QCP at $\delta$=1; (e) a for $\delta$=1.8 providing a realistic description of the data; (f) undergoing a qualitative change in the dispersion at $\delta$=3; (g) large $\delta$ limit. The parameters used were $\lambda$=50 meV, $\delta$=1.8, $\eta$=0.25, $\Delta'$=4.7. For the ordered phase (c-g), the thickness of the line is proportional to the intensity. (h) The intensities for $x$ and $y$ modes as a function of momentum for $\delta$=1.5. (i) The ratio of the $y$ to $x$ mode as a function of $\delta$.
