\label{fig:fig1} {\bf Spin-wave spectra of \CROns.} (a) INS spectra measured in a time-of-flight spectrometer integrated in the $L$ direction in the range $2\leq L \leq4$ and plotted along high symmetry directions in the $HK$ plane. The spectra contains contributions from both magnetic and phonon scattering. (b) Simulation of the spin-wave using our model. (c) An illustration of Heisenberg spin-wave dispersion relations.
