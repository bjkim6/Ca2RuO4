\label{fig:fig1} {\bf Crystal electric field drives the QCP.} (a) Tuning of the effective splitting \leff through tetragonal compression of RuO$_6$ octahedra. (b) Energy level diagram for the triplet levels calculated by diagonalizing the single-ion Hamiltonian including $\lambda$ and $\Delta$ in the $t_{2g}^4$ multiplet basis set. (c) The condensate density $\rho$ as a function of $\delta$ calculated from our model.
