Based on the above picture, we derive a microscopic model (see Supplementary Information) to simulate the spin-wave dispersion across the QCP as shown in Fig.~3. Our theory describes the entire range of $\delta$ (0$\leq\delta$$<\infty$) in terms of two microscopic parameters $\delta$ and $\eta\equiv J_H/U$, where $J_H$ is the Hund's coupling and $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction. The overall energy scale of $J$ is fixed by the observed spin-wave bandwidth and $\lambda$ is constrained around the experimental value ($\approx$75 meV) by the relation between $J/\lambda$ and the magnetic moment size, up to some uncertainty due to the covalency factor and quantum fluctuations reducing the moment size.
