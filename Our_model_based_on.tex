{\bf Direct confirmation of the Higgs amplitude mode using polarized neutrons}

\noindent
Experimental detection of the amplitude mode is challenging because its intensity is quickly suppressed away from the QCP (Fig.~3i), even further suppressed by the form factor due to its high energy requiring large momentum transfer (Fig. SXX).  Therefore, we used polarized neutrons to isolate magnetic signals, and thereby unambiguously establish the Higgs mode. Because of our sample mosaic, consisting of $\sim$100 individual single crystals, is twinned, i.e. $a$ and $b$ axes are mixed (see Supplementary Information), we can only distinguish between in-plane and out-of-plane polarization of the magnetic modes.
